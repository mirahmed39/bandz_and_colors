# bandz_and_colors
Two express.js applications that 1.  Creates a webpage to store all info about music bands 2. Creates a color pallete after getting a input from the user the user

## Further Details:
This application uses in-memory as data storage (in other words, data is only persistent while the session is active)

I have made these two projects to get a good handle on the basic of the express framework. For example, I have got a good grasp on how to 
handle post and get reqeust, form data, redirect with data, displaying the result after form is submitted etc.
